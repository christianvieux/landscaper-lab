# Landscaper Game

A simple terminal-based game created for General Assembly's Software Engineering Bootcamp.

## Description

In this game, you start a landscaping business with nothing but your teeth. You work your way up from cutting lawns with your teeth to managing a team of workers, gradually upgrading your tools to earn more money per day.

## How to Play

1. Run the game by typing `python game.py` in your terminal
2. Enter your name when prompted
3. Cut lawns to earn money
4. Purchase better tools from the shop to increase your earnings
5. Win the game by hiring a team of students and earning $1000

## Tools & Earnings

| Tool | Cost | Earnings per day |
|------|------|------------------|
| Teeth | Free | $1 |
| Rusty Scissors | $5 | $5 |
| Push Lawnmower | $25 | $25 |
| Battery-powered Lawnmower | $250 | $100 |
| Team of Students | $500 | $250 |

## My Process

This was a new experience for me as I'm still learning Python (and don't know much JavaScript yet). The code works as intended but looking back, I see ways I could improve it by:

- Making the logic more dynamic
- Creating more scalable tool/item management
- Implementing better code organization

I plan to revisit this project later to apply these improvements as I continue learning.

## Technologies Used
